Human wildlife interaction near agricultural zones requires solutions that are preventive, ethical, and technically robust. Most existing systems focus only on detection and post intrusion alerts. Our approach moves beyond passive monitoring by combining intelligent detection with adaptive, species specific ultrasound deterrence that actively prevents animals from entering farmlands. We propose an AI driven crop protection and wildlife movement analysis system built on edge computing architecture. The system integrates computer vision and thermal sensing to detect animals in real time under both daylight and low visibility conditions. A lightweight trained model running on an embedded platform identifies the presence and probable species of the intruding animal. The key innovation lies in the adaptive sound response layer. Instead of emitting a generic alarm, the system generates controlled sound patterns tailored to specific animal behavior. Research indicates that elephants are sensitive to certain low frequency rumbles and sudden high frequency bursts, which can create discomfort or alertness without causing harm. Wild boars respond strongly to sharp, irregular high pitch sound pulses. Deer and similar herbivores tend to retreat when exposed to abrupt ultrasonic signals combined with fluctuating acoustic patterns. By dynamically selecting sound signatures based on detected species, the system increases deterrence efficiency while remaining non lethal and eco friendly. This real time acoustic intervention ensures that animals are discouraged before they fully enter and damage crops. Unlike conventional warning systems that notify farmers after intrusion, our solution immediately acts at the boundary level. This significantly reduces economic loss, prevents crop destruction, and minimizes panic driven or harmful retaliation against wildlife. In parallel, the system logs animal movement data and transmits alerts through long range communication modules to nearby farmers or local authorities. Over time, this data can be used to analyze recurring movement corridors between reserve forests and habitation zones. Such insights support wildlife management planning, strategic fencing decisions, and early warning networks for surrounding communities. The solution is designed to be practical and cost effective. It operates offline, is solar powered, and built with modular hardware components for scalable deployment. Multiple nodes can be installed across large agricultural fields to create a protective acoustic perimeter. Our innovation lies in shifting the paradigm from detection and reporting to detection and prevention. By integrating AI based recognition with adaptive ultrasound deterrence, the system not only identifies wildlife presence but actively ensures that animals retreat safely. At the same time, it contributes to long term ecological data collection, promoting balanced coexistence between farmers and wildlife. This approach protects livelihoods, supports sustainable agriculture, and provides a humane, technology driven framework for managing human wildlife conflict.
